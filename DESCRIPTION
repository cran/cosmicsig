Description: A data package with 2 main package variables: 'signature' and 'etiology'. 
     The 'signature' variable contains the latest mutational signature profiles 
     released on COSMIC <https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/> for 3 mutation
     types:
     * Single base substitutions in the context of preceding and following bases,
     * Doublet base substitutions, and
     * Small insertions and deletions.
    The 'etiology' variable provides the known or hypothesized causes of signatures. 
    'cosmicsig' stands for COSMIC signatures. Please run ?'cosmicsig' for more
    information.
